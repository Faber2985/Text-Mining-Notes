# Text-Mining-Notes
This repository contains my notes on text mining and my experiments.

Check the .md file in the repository ([LINK TO MD FILE](https://github.com/michelucci/Text-Mining-Notes/blob/master/text-mining-notes.md)) to see code, comments, explanations and images. Feel free to download the code and use it for your project. 

Feel free to use the code any way you want. A thank you or a link if you put this material on your blog/website would be nice.
